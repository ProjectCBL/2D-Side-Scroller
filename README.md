# 2D-Side-Scroller
A small 2D platform shooter that uses Kenny's  "Pixel Line Platformer" asset pack.  The Project was made in unity and only uses pre-built shapes and fonts along with the asset pack.  This was my first attempt at creating a semi-full platformer in Unity.

The controls are as follows:

A -- Move Left

D -- Move Right

J -- Jump

K -- Shoot (If gun is equipped)
